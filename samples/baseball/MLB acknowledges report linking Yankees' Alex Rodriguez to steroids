Major League Baseball has said that it is "extremely disappointed" about a new report that says records from an anti-aging clinic in the Miami area link the New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez and other players to the purchase of performance-enhancing drugs.

The Miami New Times said in a story on Tuesday that it had obtained files through an employee at a recently closed clinic called Biogenesis. MLB responded with a statement, in which it said: "Through our Department of Investigations, we have been actively involved in the issues in South Florida."

The unsigned statement also said: "We are always extremely disappointed to learn of potential links between players and the use of performance-enhancing substances."

Other players on the list include Melky Cabrera, Gio González, Bartolo Colón and Nelson Cruz. Cabrera and Colón were suspended for failing drug tests last season. Rodriguez has admitted using steroids from 2001 to 2003 but said that he stopped after that.
