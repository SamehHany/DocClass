The Chicago Blackhawks equaled an NHL record start to the season with 16 straight games with at least one point after beating the Vancouver Canucks 4-3 in a shootout Tuesday.

Patrick Kane and Andrew Shaw scored in the tiebreaker for the Blackhawks, who earned their third consecutive win and joined the 2006-07 Anaheim Ducks as the only teams to record at least one point in the first 16 games of a season. Chicago will go for the record Friday night when it hosts the San Jose Sharks for the second time in a week.

Alexander Edler and Kevin Bieksa each scored in the final 2:42 of regulation for the Canucks, and Daniel Sedin had a goal and an assist.

Montreal's Alex Galchenyuk snapped a deadlock early in the third period as the Canadiens held off the New York Rangers 3-1 for their fifth consecutive win.

Raphael Diaz added an empty-net goal with 1:06 remaining for the Canadiens, who have outscored opponents 15-5 during their streak.

Defenseman Anton Stralman netted his second of the season for the Rangers.

At Tampa, Florida, Steven Stamkos scored his 10th goal and Benoit Pouliot had three assists as the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2.

Vincent Lecavalier, Alexander Killorn and Matthew Carle also scored for the Lightning, who have won two in a row.

Winnipeg's Ondrej Pavelec made 29 saves to help the Jets end a three-game skid with a 2-1 win over the Buffalo Sabres, while Andre Benoit and Dave Dziurzynski scored their first NHL goals in the Ottawa Senators' 3-1 victory over the New York Islanders.

In other games, the Nashville Predators beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-3 in overtime, the San Jose Sharks beat the St. Louis Blues 2-1, and the Los Angeles Kings downed the Edmonton Oilers 3-1.
